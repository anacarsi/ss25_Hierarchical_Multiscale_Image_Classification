def computeITCList(evaluation_mask, resolution, level):
    """
    Compute the list of labels containing Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC)
    
    Description:
        A region is considered ITC if its longest diameter is below 200µm.
        As we expanded the annotations by 75µm, the major axis of the object 
        should be less than 275µm to be considered as ITC (Each pixel is 
        0.243µm*0.243µm in level 0). Therefore the major axis of the object 
        in level 5 should be less than 275/(2^5*0.243) = 35.36 pixels.
        
    Parameters:
        evaluation_mask:    The evaluation mask
        resolution:         Pixel resolution of the image at level 0
        level:              The level at which the evaluation mask was made
